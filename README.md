# Ottoman Turkish Keyboard Layout

Turkish people were using an Arabic-script based alphabet until 1928. Government decided to migrate to a new latin-script based alphabet that time.
I built a Windows keyboard layout which is for Arabic-script based alphabet.

It mimics the latin-based Turkish Q keyboard layout for Windows.

**Please note that `klc` file must have Windows line endings (\r\n). Otherwise Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator tool cannot read it.**
